## Developer information

The agents and tools framework is flexible and extensible. You can find the list of tools provided by OpenSearch in the [Tools library](https://github.com/opensearch-project/skills/tree/main/src/main/java/org/opensearch/agent/tools). For a different use case, you can build your own tool by implementing the [_Tool_ interface](https://github.com/opensearch-project/ml-commons/blob/2.x/spi/src/main/java/org/opensearch/ml/common/spi/tools/Tool.java).
